# Data-Analysis-of-an-Experiment-on-Nematic-Liquid-Crystals.
This project constitutes an illustration of how I analyze data I collect from a laboratory experiment; which in this case aims to calculate the response times, threshold voltage and viscosity (at different temperatures) of the Nematic Liquid Crystal 5CB.  The data analyzed were not measured by me, they were generated with pseudo-random algorithm (to simulate errors). The script that performs the analysis is written in python and produces analytic plots of my findings.
